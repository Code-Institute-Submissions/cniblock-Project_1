                    Peter is the Head of "Zebra Tech" innovation space which
                    opened in September 2021. "Zebra Tech" philosophy is to
                    identify legaltech, regtech and dealtech companies relevant
                    to Zebra lawyers and their clients and to find ways to start

                  Prior to launching "Zebra Tech", Peter was a Counsel in the
                  Derivatives and Structured Finance group based in London,
                  specialising in credit derivatives (involving drafting almost
                  all of the standard documentation in this area over the last
                  decade). Peter is now the first person at Zebra to have
                  directly been promoted to partner into its Advanced Delivery &
                  Solutions offering. He is also on Zebra’s i2 panel and
                  Advanced Delivery Board (tasked with authorising funding for
                  pilots and larger projects, respectively).
