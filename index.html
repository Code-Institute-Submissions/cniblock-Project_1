          <br />

          <p>
            Welcome to a new breed. Our mission is to be a best in class legal
            business partner operating within the Defendant PI market. We are a
            tech oriented, boutique legal business that offers a range of
            innovative services designed to support the Insurance Sector, and
            especially the disruptive MGA market.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As a collaboration between two experienced Defendant PI lawyers,
            with over 35 years' experience in the claims industry, and the award
            winning Freedom Services Group, Zebra has unique insight into the
            current challenges and opportunities prevalent within the sector.
            This enables us to add genuine value to our partners via innovative
            solutions targeted across the full scope of insurance operations
            which impact key areas such as loss ratio and claims spend.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our focus is on leveraging our sub-specialisms in areas such as
            telematics, fraud and large loss to remove spend from the claims
            journey, whilst protecting our partner's wider interests via
            targeted strategic litigation. We are also disruptive in the volume
            motor space by virtue of our collaborative partnerships. We
            recognise and champion early collaboration in the claims space and
            openly support our clients with consultancy services that depart
            from traditional legal service models.
