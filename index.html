          <h2>About Us</h2>

          <p>
            Welcome to a new breed. Our mission is to be a best in class legal
            business partner operating within the Defendant PI market. We are a
            tech oriented, boutique legal business that offers a range of
            innovative services designed to support the Insurance Sector, and
            especially the disruptive MGA market.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a collaboration between two experienced Defendant PI lawyers,
            with over 35 years' experience in the claims industry, and the award
            winning Freedom Services Group, Zebra has unique insight into the
            current challenges and opportunities prevalent within the sector.
            This enables us to add genuine value to our partners via innovative
            solutions targeted across the full scope of insurance operations
            which impact key areas such as loss ratio and claims spend.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our focus is on leveraging our sub-specialisms in areas such as
            telematics, fraud and large loss to remove spend from the claims
            journey, whilst protecting our partner's wider interests via
            targeted strategic litigation. We are also disruptive in the volume
            motor space by virtue of our collaborative partnerships. We
            recognise and champion early collaboration in the claims space and
            openly support our clients with consultancy services that depart
            from traditional legal service models.

                Donald Trump committed fraud for years while building the real
                estate empire that catapulted him to fame and the White House, a
                New York judge ruled on Tuesday in a strongly worded rejection
                of the former president’s bid to throw out a civil lawsuit
                against him.

                  Carlisle solicitor's concern over falling duty lawyer
                  numbers</a

              </h4>
              <p>
                Concerns have been raised by a solicitor about a reduction in
                the number of duty lawyers. Chris Toms, a solicitor based in
                Carlisle said the number of duty lawyers there has fallen from
                21 in 2007 to a current figure of 11. He believed the number
                would be reduced to seven duty lawyers in the coming years as
                more solicitors retired.

                Merging parties like Hitachi and Thales are finding it
                increasingly difficult to manage twin remedy negotiations in the
                UK and EU, Hitachi Rail’s head of competition has warned.
