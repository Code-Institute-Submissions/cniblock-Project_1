### USER GOAL
To clearly see what the Law Firm's services are.
What the philosophy of the firm is.
Who the CEO's are and colleagues they work with and also the career information of both.
Users will be able to fill out a form if they are interested in a career with the firm.
Contact information and office details / map will be available on the website.

### SITE OWNER GOALS
To have a fully functional and customised website that can go more in depth than Linkedin and also have more of a personal touch.
It will allow the owner to look professional and give the option of users to contact them and start communication channels.

## Testing

The deployed website has been vigorously tested on multiple web browsers and devices.

* Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari web browsers have been tested on.
* 4k Monitor, 2k monitor, 1080p, iPad and iPhone devices have been tested on.

One of the main issues I found was that when I developing the page I was using "min-width" on some images and divs which were resulting in poor responsiveness, meaning that when I would shrink the page down - the image would appear fine but the rest of the elements on the page would squash to the side of the page.

During the Testing stage I found that certain margin settings worked well on Desktop but then not when viewed on iPad and iPhone safari. This was resolved by changing margin settings.

### Validator Testing

* HTML
  *  I can confirm that all HTML on each page has passed without error in the official [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

* CSS
  *  I can confirm that all CSS has passed without error in the official [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)

### Accessibility 

Scores for accessibility on each page is Green and in the high 90's.

### Unfixed Bugs

There are no unfixed bugs on the website. 
Only a few things that I would have possibly changed.

* The Header could have perhaps had a max-width to match the Hero image.
* The Header has a lot of media changes to be responsive, having a dropdown menu may have been a more sensible option.

## Deployment

The website has been deployed for several days and it has been very helpful in testing the website on numerous devices.

The process I followed for deploying the website is as follows
* From my github project I went to **Settings**,
* Then selected **Pages** on the left hand menu,
* Under **Source** I selected **Deploy from a branch**,
* Finally, under **branch** I set it to **main** - **root** and save.
